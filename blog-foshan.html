                <p>This summer vacation, I traveled to Foshan - the hometown of Wong Fei-hung and Ip Man. At the Ancestral Temple, I was fortunate to watch an amazing lion dance performance. Watching the lions leap flexibly between high poles, I finally understood what "one minute on stage takes ten years of practice off stage" truly means.</p>

                        <p class="image-caption">Delicious Shunde double-skin milk pudding</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>What surprised me even more was Foshan's food! In Shunde, I tasted authentic double-skin milk, ginger milk, and the unforgettable Jun'an steamed pork. As a food lover, this place is simply heaven!</p>

                <blockquote class="article-quote">
                    "Foshan taught me that the best journeys engage all senses - watching lion dance, tasting local flavors, and creating with your own hands."
                </blockquote>

                <p>The most memorable experience was in the ceramic town of Shiwan, where I tried pottery-making myself. Although my creation was wobbly and uneven, the joy of creating something with my own hands was priceless. The master potter showed me how a single piece of clay could transform into beautiful art through patience and skill.</p>
